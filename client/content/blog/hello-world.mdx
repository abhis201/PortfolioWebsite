# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using MDX. I can write markdown and use React components seamlessly.

## Features

- MDX Support
- Syntax Highlighting
- React Components
- Code Blocks

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

You can even use custom React components within your MDX files!
